# Fritter Visual Design Student Example - Kathryn Jin & Gloria Lin

## Kathryn's Solution
We loved the simplicity, compactness, and usability of Kathryn's wireframe designs. The flow is also clear from moqups. Kathryn's submission is a fantastic example of how simple designs are often the most memorable, aesthetic, and effective!

## Gloria's Solution
Many student wireframes looked great, and Gloria's are no exception. What stood out about Gloria's submission was its excellent guided demonstration of flows between wireframes. By using names of her users and showing the different ways they interact with the application, Gloria made it easy to see how the application is meant to be used and how simple it is to do so.

Great job to both of you!
